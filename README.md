# coffee-bytes
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/coffee-bytes

When I open the source of ThreadLocalRandom with coffee-bytes, a NullPointerException occurs.
So I modify the code to work around it. Now, it works good with normal source files. 
But with ThreadLocalRandom, it act as if coffee-bytes is not installed.

This is certainly not a good solution, hope someone else settle it.
